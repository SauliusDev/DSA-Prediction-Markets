It rewards those who deploy capital strategically \u2014 allocating more when confidence is high and risk is justified \u2014 rather than those who simply win often with small, low-impact trades.\n\nSmart Score evolves over time as a trader's behavior and performance change. That means it can **improve or deteriorate** depending on recent activity \u2014 making it essential to **track regularly** to detect meaningful shifts in strategy or skill.",
